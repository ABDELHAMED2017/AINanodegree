#### Project 1 - Creating an AI Agent to solve Sudoku

- Used constraint propagation and depth first search (DFS) to create a sudoku solving agent.
- Implemented the naked twins strategy as part of constraint propagation for solving sudokus.
- Incorporated diagonal constraints into the the sudoku solving constraint propagation strategies such as eliminate, naked twins and only choice to enable the AI agent to solve diagonal sudokus.
